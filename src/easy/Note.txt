-- Reverse String -- 
String  , StringBuffer , StringBuilder

Mutability Difference:
String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created, 
whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.

Thread-Safety Difference:
The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe. 
So when the application needs to be run only in a single thread then it is better to use StringBuilder. 
StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.

Situations:
1>. If your string is not going to change use a String class because a String object is immutable.
2>. If your string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) 
	and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a StringBuilder is good enough.
3>. If your string can change, and will be accessed from multiple threads, 
	use a StringBuffer because StringBuffer is synchronous so you have thread-safety.
